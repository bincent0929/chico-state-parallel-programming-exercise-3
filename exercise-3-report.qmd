## 1.

### a).

For testing the Riemann sum sequentially, I compiled and ran `hello_riemann.cpp` in integrating a constant function $f(x) = 10.0$ over the interval $0$ to $10.0$ using a step size of $1000000$ at a precision of $15$.

This was the result:
```bash
$ ./hello_riemann 
Will run with default: thread_count=1
The integral of f(x) from 0.0 to 10 with 1000000 steps is 100
```

For testing the Trapezoidal sum sequentially, I compiled and ran `hello_trapezoidal_constant.cpp`. I used the same values as above with the Riemann sum, and this, as you may expect, was the output:

```bash
$ ./hello_trapezoidal_constant 
Will run with default: thread_count=1
The integral of f(x) from 0.0 to 10 with 1000000 steps is 100
```
