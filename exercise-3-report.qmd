## 1.

### a).

For testing the Riemann sum sequentially (using the left sum), I compiled and ran `hello_riemann.cpp` in integrating a constant function $f(x) = 10.0$ over the interval $0$ to $10.0$ using a step size of $1000000$ at a precision of $15$.

This was the result:
```bash
$ ./hello_riemann 
Will run with default: thread_count=1
The integral of f(x) from 0.0 to 10 with 1000000 steps is 100
```

For testing the Trapezoidal sum sequentially, I compiled and ran `hello_trapezoidal_constant.cpp`. I used the same values as above with the Riemann sum, and this, as you may expect, was the output:

```bash
$ ./hello_trapezoidal_constant 
Will run with default: thread_count=1
The integral of f(x) from 0.0 to 10 with 1000000 steps is 100
```

### b).

Here's the result of $f(x)=sin(x)$ using the trapezoidal method:
```bash
$ ./hello_trapezoidal 
Will run with default: thread_count=1
The integral of f(x) from 0.0 to 3.14159265358979 with 1000000 steps is 1.99999999999841
```

And here's for the Riemann sum (using the left):
```bash
$ ./hello_riemann 
Will run with default: thread_count=1
The integral of f(x) from 0.0 to 3.14159265358979 with 1000000 steps is 1.99999999999841
```

### c).

Check out `MPI_Examples/simple_function_mpi_trap.c` and see my code.

The output for it is:
```bash
$ mpiexec -n 1 ./simple_function_mpi_trap
With n = 4 trapezoids, our estimate
of the integral from 0.000000 to 100000.000000 = 1.000000000000000e+06
```

## 2.

Ok, so right now I'm butting my head up against the specification of the document.
